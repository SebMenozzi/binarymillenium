#summary Might & Magic style first-person 3D tile world

= Introduction =

I thought I'd learn the basics of the Google Web Toolkit, and make a simple tiled 3D world to explore.

Code:
http://binarymillenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gwt/tiles/

Run tiles-compile & tiles-shell to run it (or open it in a browser).

TBD - will uploading the compiled files to the wiki allow the project to be run on code.google?

So far it doesn't look like it, it renders the html as a text file and probably wouldn't allow javascript to run anyway.
