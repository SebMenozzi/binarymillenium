#summary Might and Magic style first-person 3D tile world

= Introduction =

I thought I'd learn the basics of the Google Web Toolkit, and make a simple tiled 3D world to explore.

Run the game here:
http://binarymillenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gwt/tiles/www/binarymillenium.tiles.Tiles/Tiles.html

http://binarymillenium.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/gwt/gwt_tiles.png

= Details =

Code:
http://binarymillenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gwt/tiles/

Run tiles-compile & tiles-shell to run it (or open it in a browser).

In order to upload the game to svn properly, subversion needs to know that the html files are in fact html rather than text:

svn propset svn:mime-type text/html *html
