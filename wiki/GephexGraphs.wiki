There needs to be more example videos along with downloadable graphs, so I'll take some of mine and allow them to be used by anyone.

The basics of this graph is two mixers and a plasma block, but it needs a lot of tuning to look cool.  The source input is pretty important, the ising noise block isn't the best but I think I made it work.

Feedback can be pretty compelling, but typically leads to periodicity- signal generators set to noize can avoid too much repetition but any effect looks samey after a while.
