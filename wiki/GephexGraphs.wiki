There needs to be more example videos along with downloadable graphs, so I'll take some of mine and allow them to be used by anyone.

*Basic Plasma*

The basics of this graph is two mixers and a plasma block, but it needs a lot of tuning to look cool.  The source input is pretty important, the ising noise block isn't the best but I think I made it work.

Feedback can be pretty compelling, but typically leads to periodicity- signal generators set to noize can avoid too much repetition but any effect looks samey after a while.
