A demonstration of using the current rendered opengl screen as a texture within the same scene.

This is a video of this program and another feedback program in action:

I built this using OpenSceneGraph 1.2 in Cygwin.

See http://binarymillenium.blogspot.com/2007/02/screen-capture-with-wxwindows.html for details on the screen capture code.

The regular OpenGL context code is much simpler, it's done with

            image->readPixels( startx, 
                    starty,
                    tex_width, 
                    tex_height, 
                    GL_RGB,GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE);

Where image is an Osg::Image.  It also has a callback and other details which are the same as in the osgprerender example, where I started from.
